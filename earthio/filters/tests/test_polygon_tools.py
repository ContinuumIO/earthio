    # a backwards C shape and a square.
    # The quad poly is defined clockwise and hangs off the grid in the Y direction
    # and has:
    #  * Two of the edges intersect a point somewhere on their length.
    # The backwards C poly is defined anti-clockwise and has:
    #  * A flat bottom edge for edge detection testing.
    #  * The third and sixth vertex is exactly on a grid point for testing
    #    point detection.
    #  * Hangs off the grid in the X direction
    # The combination of these polygons creates an overlapping shape which has a
    # hole in the middle (it's a lumpy doughnut). In the hole is a single
    # point (at [6, 3]) which is not to be selected.
    # The square poly is defined anti-clockwise and its edges align to the underlying
    # grid and surround a single point. This polygon does not overlap the others and
    # is present to check edge detection works on all edges and vertices.
