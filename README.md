# Ensemble Learning Models - Data Readers

### Work in Progress

Currently this can be installed with

```
git clone https://github.com/ContinuumIO/earth-env
cd earth-env && conda env create --file environment_36.yml
cd ../elm-readers && python setup.py develop
python -c "from elm.readers import *"
```
Tests are probably still broken due to package move refactor.
